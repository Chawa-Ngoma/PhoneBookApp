# Phonebook Application
A simple Phonebook Application built using Blazor WebAssembly with a .NET 8 backend and SQLite as a database. This project allows users to add, update, delete, and search for contacts, with validations in place to ensure phone numbers are unique.

You need to run both API and Frontend at the same time, you would need to right click on the PhoneBook solution then go to properties.
You would then select the "Multiple startup projects" option and then set the action for both API and PhoneApp to "Start"
